* Eat them when they are [most fresh](http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/fruits/oranges/harvesting-oranges.htm).
* They are the best eaten at 12C temperature. Keep oranges in the fridge before eating.
* Don't peel the oranges by hand. Cut them to wedges and slice the skin off with a fillet knife.

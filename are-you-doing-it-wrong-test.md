# Are you doing it wrong?

If you can check everything on this list, congratulations, you are doing it right!

### Joel Test

- [ ] Do you use source control?
- [ ] Can you make a build in one step?
- [ ] Do you make daily builds?
- [ ] Do you have a bug database?
- [ ] Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
- [ ] Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
- [ ] Do you have a spec?
- [ ] Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
- [ ] Do you use the best tools money can buy?
- [ ] Do you have testers?
- [ ] Do new candidates write code during their interview?
- [ ] Do you do hallway usability testing?

### My questions

- [ ] Do you have a documentation which tells exactly what your product is?
    You will explain the project to new members anyways, just document what you tell them.

- [ ] Are you proud of your codebase?
- [ ] Are your co-workers proud of the codebase?
- [ ] Do you have a *start here* documentation for new project members?
- [ ] Is your *start here* documentation so good that you don't need to explain it further?
- [ ] Can you refactor your code without fearing that your app won't work?
- [ ] Do you have strict conventions about project style(*tab/space, indent, naming)*
    If you don't eventually your code will be a mess of different styles:
    * Diffs will be polluted by mix of spaces and tabs
    * Code is hard to read

-[ ] Do you know how outdated your project's dependencies are?
    You should have a single meter like: 6/10 of dependencies are outdated

- [ ] Would you be comfortable to show your code to other team members?
    If not, are you coding crap?

- [ ] Can every member of your team handle rough critic of their code?
    Everyone should be able to handle comments like:

    * *"Your code looks like shit, because ..."*
    * *"Your technical choice was bad, because ..."*

    If not, members are afraid to give feedback and code will eventually rotten.

##### Web
- [ ] Do you version your product?

    If you don't have a version, you'll eventually be confused what version is deployed to staging/test/prod.

- [ ] Do you have deployment scripts in version control?
- [ ] Do you know how outdated your hosting servers are?
- [x] Can you easily replicate testing/staging/production environment locally for testing?
